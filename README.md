#All Ghost Themes

These are the theme files used for http://allghostthemes.com

###Quick Overview
On the home page and tag pages, we are using Datatables.js to sort and allow for instant searching.

As Ghost goes through each post, it does the following:

* Finds a picture in the asset/images folder that has the same name as the title of the post
* Checks the post for a tag with a $ and posts it in the price column
* Searches for a tag with just a number to put into the columns
* Puts an excerpt into the description

Tag Pages do the same as above just for the specific tags

Each post has a description and and embedded iframe to show the demo directly inside the page


###PR's and suggestions welcome :D
